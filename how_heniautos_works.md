# Notes for porting what heniautos is doing

1. Get dates for 2 closest summer solstices (i.e. the ones before and after "now")
2. Get New Moons between those dates
3. Get the correct "start" date based on when to start after new moon (default new moon + 2)
4. Those are now the start/end times for the months
5. If 12 moons in the period - no intercalation
6. If not-12 moons - intercalate Poseideon2 (possibility for customization of which month to intercalate) in the appropriate position
